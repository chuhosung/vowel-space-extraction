Vowel Space Automatic Extraction

This project aims to automatically extract vowel space using formant data from speech samples. The code reads formant data (F1, F2) from CSV files for different vowels, calculates stable formant values, and visualizes the vowel triangle for both a participant and normal reference values.

Features

Automatic Formant Extraction: Extracts F1 and F2 formant values from CSV files.

Stable Value Selection: Uses median and mode to select stable formant values.

Vowel Space Area (VSA) Calculation: Computes the Vowel Space Area using Heron's formula.

Visualization: Draws vowel triangles for participant and normal reference values.

Analysis and Feedback: Provides an interpretation of how the participant's formant values differ from the normal range.

FastTrack Integration

This project utilizes the FastTrack Praat script developed by Santiago Barreda. FastTrack generates Excel files with formant data at 0.02-second intervals. By analyzing these detailed formant data outputs, we identified stable segments to create a vowel triangle graph. This visual feedback is particularly useful for speech-language pathologists (SLPs), as it allows them to evaluate pronunciation accuracy and provide visual feedback to clients.

Using the Excel files generated by FastTrack, you can easily extract formant data and visualize the vowel triangle, making it valuable for speech therapy or phonetic research.

Installation

Clone the Repository

git clone <repository_url>

Install Required Packages
Python 3.8 or above is required. Install the necessary packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Prepare Input CSV Files: CSV files containing formant data for the vowels /a/, /i/, /u/ are needed. The CSV files must contain columns named f1 and f2 for the formant values.

Run the Script: Execute the Python script to extract and visualize the vowel space:

python extract_vowel_space.py

Output: The script will generate a plot showing the vowel triangle for both the participant and normal reference values, along with a table summarizing F1, F2 values, and VSA comparison.

Example Output

Vowel Triangle Plot: Compares the participant and normal vowel spaces.

Data Table: Summarizes the F1, F2 values for each vowel and compares the Vowel Space Area (VSA).

Interpretation: Analyzes whether the tongue movement was more forward or backward and the impact on speech clarity.
